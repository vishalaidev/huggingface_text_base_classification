Notebook Description: PaliGemma with QLoRA
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates fine-tuning and optimization of the PaliGemma model using the QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. The focus is on enabling efficient training of large language models through low-rank adaptations and quantization methods. Below are the key steps and components included in the notebook:

Setup and Installation
Install the Hugging Face Transformers library:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
pip install -e .
Ensure Python version is 3.9.19.
Imports and Initialization
Key Libraries:
Essential libraries such as torch, datasets, transformers, and peft are imported.
Model:
The base model used is google/paligemma-3b-pt-224.
Device Selection:
The notebook dynamically selects the computation device (cuda for GPU or cpu).
Dataset Handling
The notebook loads a dataset for training and evaluation using datasets.load_dataset.


This notebook is designed for efficient training of large models, making it particularly useful for research and practical applications where computational resources are limited. Would you like to refine this further or include specific details about the fine-tuning process?
